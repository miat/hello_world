## Visual Studio Code and Personal Access Token

1. Get personal access token from https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Save access token. Can begin with something like ghp_pVC**.
3. In Visual Studio Code terminal,
4.      git remote set-url origin https://<personal_access_token>@github.com/<user_name>/<repo_name>.git
  
That's it. Publishing to github should work.
